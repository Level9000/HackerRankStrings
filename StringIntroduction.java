/*
 * "A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable." � Wikipedia: String (computer science)
 * This exercise is to test your understanding of Java Strings. A sample String declaration:
 * String myString = "Hello World!"
 * The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, 
 * and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.
 * Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:
 * Sum the lengths of A and B.
 * Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
 * Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.
